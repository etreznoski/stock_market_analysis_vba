# Stock Market Analysis


### Use VBA to analyze stock market data:

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
